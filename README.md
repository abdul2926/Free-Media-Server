# Free Media Server
Free Media Server is a lightweight, easy to use and minimal media server for your local network.  

### Installation
Move to a folder of your choosing and run `npm start`

### Usage
Define the location of your libraries in the settings page. Seperate new directories with a `;`.
You can also set a password (password lock is currently semi broken) in the settings page and change the server port. It is not recommended to allow access outside of your local network because security was not on the priority list.
